## AI 

Artificial Intelligence (AI), encompasses a wide range of techniques that allow machines to mimic human cognitive abilities like learning, reasoning, and problem-solving. Coined by Stanford Professor John McCarthy in 1955, he defined AI as “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines”. [^manning] Previous iterations include Alan Turing’s Turing test, conducted in 1950, followed by the first chatbot ELIZA in the 1960s, the IBM deep blue computer chess game in 1977, Apple’s Siri in 2011 and OpenAI in 2015.

Andrew C. Staugaard adds to the definition of AI as being the “mechanization, or duplication, of the human thought process”. [^staugaard] The use of Machine Learning algorithms has helped us expand our toolset to include a series of three learning processes; Supervised Learning (using labelled data to predict diversity), Unsupervised Learning (analyzing unlabelled data to learn what is not initially apparent), and Reinforcement Learning (a feedback dependant process which must be reprimanded when predicting incorrect outputs). [^saha] 

Deep Learning is a concept in which the computer simulates human processes to analyze, think and learn, requiring vast amounts of data to train correctly. [^saha] These two subsets of AI use high performance algorithms and multilayer neural networks to solve complex problems. [^ghosh] These can lead to innovations in medicine, technology, and integration into the social sector. 

In the context of new media, we can see these advancements as productive tools for creativity, enabling automation of processes, customization of dynamic workflows, and advanced data analysis. We can draw connections to how algorithms function on social media platforms, performing tasks adapted to individual preferences, such as curating personalized content based on likes, predicting trends and behaviors to engage the viewer in more sophisticated ways. From this point of view, AI becomes an active participant in the process, optimizing interactions to align with individuals in more meaningful ways.
