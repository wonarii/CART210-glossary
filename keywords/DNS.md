## DNS

DNS stands for Domain Name System. It was invented by Paul Mockapetris in 1983. [^cocoran11branding]

Each computer and server have their own IP address, a series of numbers, similar to how houses have addresses for their locations. 
To be able to connect to another computer through the internet, it was required to know the IP address. An IP address is a series of 
numbers that would point to the location of the site, similar to how our home addresses tell us where we are geographically.

In the past, to find this specific number, a `hosts.txt` file had a table with the name of the host linked to their IP address. 
However, this file had to be updated every time a new “location” was created. With the rise of the Internet, it quickly fell behind. [^cocoran11branding]
To fix this issue, Paul Mockapetris invented the domain name system. 
This system takes domain names and translates them into IP addresses for the browser to use. [^cloudflare25DNS] The system is divided into different categories and levels to help organization and navigation.
While most top-level domains categorize sites by geographical location, they also have a few to signify the site’s purpose. For example, “ca” is for canadian sites, “com” is for commercial sites and “org” is for non-profit organizations.
You could also add subdomains for even more specificity. They just have to be separated by a dot. Example: https://library.concordia.ca/
The “.ca” part is the top-level domain and there’s the subdomain “.concordia”.
This helps connect sites to each other and signify relationships between different pages. [^cocoran11branding]

The creation of the DNS led to a much more accessible Internet. Rather than having to remember and type long strings of numbers to reach other sites, 
users could now use words that are much easier to remember and in most cases shorter to type out. 
This made the Internet more appealing and accessible to the masses which led to an even bigger influx of users. [^cocoran11branding]

Without the DNS, new media that uses the online world as it’s main platform to be shared or diffused may not have been as accessible. The domain name, or name used to find a website has become an important part of that site’s identity. Websites are recognized by their domain names.
The DNS also paved the way for the World Wide Web and helped the Internet become what it is today. [^veaandreubonastre19origins]
