## E-Commerce

E-commerce (electronic commerce) is a term for buying and selling stuff through the internet. The increase of e-commerce over the years has been helped a lot by the increase of digital 
payment systems that have secure transactions and logistics networks. E-commerce’s significance in new media is shown by how it has completely changed the normal ways that the retail 
systems managed by allowing businesses to reach everyone everywhere on a global scale, without the need for a physical place. It allows for digital technologies like phones and computers 
to provide people with more convenience, variety, and better pricing. The large amount of popularity for e-commerce has also started to bring the use of new media marketing strategies, 
like social media advertising and influencer partnerships, to attract and keep customers. 

E-commerce’s relation to current technologies in the modern world is seen through the different platforms combining technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning 
with their e-commerce stores, to give the users a more personalized shopping experience, like having recommend products based off of what they have been browsing. Additionally, 
live commerce was created as a combination of live streaming and online shopping, which has came out as a new trend to give a more interactive and immersive shopping experience. [^sciencedirect.com] 
The increase of mobile apps have also improved the accessibility by allowing users to shop anytime and anywhere. 

The historical origins of e-commerce are rooted back to when the development of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) in the 1960s were created, which then allowed for businesses 
to exchange docunemnts and files like purchases that happen nowadays through the internet, getting rid of the need for paper. [^britannica.com] In 1979, Michael Aldrich lead the way for 
this kind of work by attaching a television to a transaction processing computer through a telephone line, which brought about the idea of teleshopping.[^researchgate.net] The 1990s were 
when the World Wide Web and the advancements in internet security like Secure Socket Layers (SSL), allowed online retail platforms to start making a name for themselves.

E-commerce’s influence on contemporary digital culture and society has greatly changed the user’s behaviors by changing their preferences towards online shopping because of its convenience and often 
has lower prices. It also has influenced the gig businesses, with platforms like Etsy that allows people to monetize their crafts.On top of this, e-commerce has changed the supply chain’s 
way of being by making the need for fast and effiecent delivery systems and warehousing solutions very important.
