## RGB
RGB colorspace stands for “Red, Green Blue” colorspace, which is considered an “additive” color model. It is considered additive due to the range of colors being created by adding wavelengths of the main colors together in different proportions. [^zelazko225rgbcolor]
This colorspace is usually used in screens and digital devices. Although different color depths exist for different screens, the most common way of referring to RGB colors is the HEX notation, characterized by 6 hexadecimal (0 to F) values (2). [^christensson19rgb] This notation is used due to the 24-bit color (256 values per color) being the nearest to the color spectrum visible to humans, making two hexadecimals per color perfectly represent those colors (2).

Although RGB is universal, the colors are display dependent, meaning that the colors for a same hexadecimal may appear differently on different screens (3). [^ibraheem12understanding] This is mostly due to variations in the manufacturing of the different layers of the screen, as well as the display technology used (LED vs OLED) (4). [^benq22why]
