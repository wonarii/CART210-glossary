## User
A user has many definitions, but let’s focus on the concept of an end user within the technology field. An end user is a person who utilizes a product or service such as a computer, software and many more, without involvement in its production or sell. Therefore, they are often referred to as customer and operator[^TheStateOfTheArtInEndUser]. End users typically have user accounts with usernames and passwords to authenticate themselves within a system.[^Chinel23Whatisuser]

The term "user" originates from the Old French word "user," meaning to employ or make use of, and also from Vulgar Latin "usare," which denotes making use of or taking advantage of something. The term "user" in the context of computers was invented in 1967. [^etymolineUser] One of the earliest instances of its use in the context of computing can be traced back to the pioneering work at institutions like the Digital Equipment Computer Users' Society.[^StackExchangeWhyCalledUsers]

Understanding the needs of customers who utilize the product is important for developing the best product tailored for the intended users. In addition, gathering input from users through surveys, interviews, and testing can provide valuable feedback. This feedback can help identify areas for improvement and enable the customization of the user experience to better meet the users’ needs.[^Indeed23WhatIsAnEndUser]

Users interact with technology in various ways, including navigating interfaces, inputting commands, providing data, and receiving outputs. Therefore, user experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) play a crucial role in the success of a product or service. It is important to consider the end-user experience during the developing of the products and services.[^IntuitMailchimp24EndUser]
