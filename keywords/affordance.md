## Affordance

Gibson coined the term “affordance” to describe what the environment “offers the individual, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill” 

Affordances can be viewed as animal-relative properties of the environment. They correspond to the action possibilities offered to an animal by the environment with reference to the individual’s action capabilities. For example, a leaf provides support for a wasp but not for a dog. Here, the support-ability of the leaf is an affordance for the wasp. 

Affordances can vary not only between species but also between the individuals of the same species. A 30-cm stair is climb-able for an adult but not for a child. In sum, affordances are neither objective nor subjective, but both. They are objective because they exist independently of the act of perception. But, they are also subjective because the frame of reference is the individual’s action capabilities. 

Gibson also assumed that affordance perception does not need information processing or internal representations. Rather, affordance perception is direct, corresponding to a learning process based on the extraction of invariants. An animal perceives walk-ability if it sees a flat, extended, rigid, horizontal surface, because this combination of invariants affords support.

Physical versus learned affordance

Norman was inspired by the dichotomy between the ventral system and the dorsal system and drew a close parallel between the functions of the dorsal system and affordances. Specifically, he stressed that some statements made by Gibson were somewhat equivocal. For example, Gibson wrote that the ‘values’ and ‘meanings’ of things in the environment can be directly perceived” or “postboxes afford letter mailing”. Norman proposed that only “physical affordances” are perceived by the dorsal system. So, in the aforementioned example of the postboxes, it would be better to say that slot in the mailbox affords inserting an object of appropriate size and shape.

By contrast, the ventral system is in charge to assign meanings to things, and particularly to provide information about the conventional uses of familiar tools (i.e., familiar tool use). In this case, Norman suggested the notion of “learned affordance”. The physical versus learned affordance dichotomy mirrors the novel versus familiar tool use opposition, respectively. In this view, both types of affordances can contribute to tool use, even though the ability to perform familiar tool use might be one of the properties of the ventral system. 
Importantly, this dichotomy also implies that the perception of physical affordances (dorsal system) guides not only body actions within a hand-centered frame of reference (e.g., reaching, grasping) but also novel tool use, namely, actions involving a toolcentered frame of reference. We see a contradiction in Norman’s argument as he also suggested that the transformation of visual information into a tool-centered framework (called allocentric by Norman) is the specific function of the ventral system (i.e., learned affordance).

By contrast, the dorsal system is responsible for the transformation of “visual information into an egocentric framework allowing the actor to grasp or otherwise bodily manipulate the object” 
Norman and Young (2006) have suggested that the perception of affordances – and more specifically of physical affordances for Norman – might be supported by the dorsal system. The same theoretical rapprochement may be envisaged between the dorsal system and the affordance route to action. Nevertheless, Yoon and Humphreys (2007) argued that such a rapprochement remains to be demonstrated, notably because of studies indicating that action decision tasks can activate the left inferior temporal lobe (i.e., the ventral system).[^neuro&behavior01affordance]

**Perceived affordance

The designer cares more about what actions the user perceives to be possible than what is true. Moreover, affordances, both real and perceived, play very different roles in physical products than they do in the world of screen-based products. In the latter case, affordances play a relatively minor role: cultural conventions are much more important. More on that in a moment. In product design, where one deals with real, physical objects, there can be both real and perceived affordances, and the two sets need not be the same. In graphical, screen-based interfaces, the designer primarily can control only perceived affordances. The computer system already comes with built-in physical affordances. The computer, with its keyboard, display screen, pointing device, and selection buttons (e.g., mouse buttons) affords pointing, touching, looking, and clicking on every pixel of the screen. Most of this affordance is of little interest for the purpose of the application under design. Although all screens within reaching distance afford touching, only some can detect the touch and respond to it. Thus, if the display does not have a touch-sensitive screen, the screen still affords touching, but it has no effect on the computer system. 

The traditional computer screen where the user can move the cursor to any location on the screen and click the mouse button at anytime. In this circumstance, designers sometimes will say that when they put an icon, cursor, or other target on the screen, they have added an “affordance” to the system. This is a misuse of the concept. The affordance is independent of what we see on the screen, what is displayed is not an affordance it is more of visual feedback that ADVERTISES the affordance, which makes it a perceived affordance. The difference is important because they are independent design concepts: the affordances, the feedback, and the perceived affordances can all be manipulated independently of one another.

Perceived affordances are sometimes useful even if the system does not support the real affordance.

Real affordances do not always have to have a visible presence (and in some cases, it is best to hide the real affordance).

The presence of feedback can dramatically affect the usability and understandability of a system, but quite independently of the affordances or their visibility.

The most important design tool is that of coherence and understandability, which comes through an explicit, perceivable conceptual model. Affordances specify the range of possible activities, but affordances are of little use if they are not visible to the users. Hence, the art of the designer is to ensure that the desired, relevant actions are readily perceivable.

Don’t confuse affordances with perceived affordances.
Don’t confuse affordances with conventions. Affordances reflect the possible relationships among actors and objects: they are properties of the world. Conventions, conversely, are arbitrary, artificial, and learned. Once learned, they help us master the intricacies of daily life, whether they be conventions for courtesy, for writing style, or for operating a word processor. Designers can invent new real and perceived affordances, but they cannot so readily change established social conventions.[^perceivedaffordance03affordance]
