## Agency 

Agency seems to have two meanings. On one hand, it refers simply to an organized body of people working for or under a larger form of institution, such as a governmental or political institution. On the other hand is a meaning deep rooted in philosophy and anthropology. Laura Ahearn in the Journal of Linguistic Anthropology explains that;

 “what scholars mean by it can differ considerably from common usages of the word. When I did a keyword search in our university library catalogue for agency [...] the system returned 24,728 matches (among these were result about) travel agencies, the central Intelligence Agency, social service agencies [...] few, if any, of these books use agency in the way scholars do: as a way to talk about the human capacity to act.” [^ahearn99anthropology]

This ‘scholarly’ use of the word, as Ahearn puts it, is most complex as it is often associated with conversations discussing the validity of agency, and whether it is something that humans possess. In fact, the study of history is entirely underpinned by the notion of human agency, which is the ability that humans have to intentionally shape our world.[^nash05nature]

The notion of agency in the scholarly sense is especially important in the fields surrounding the study of technology from an anthropological perspective. Human agency, that of the individual using said technology, is often put into question. The ever-changing cultural significance of social media and developing technologies has ever-changing positive and negative effects on the feeling of agency of the individual. 

For example, the self is targeted in many forms of online media. Even character customization, often featured in many online spaces, games and even social media, targets the representation of the self and, in turn, affects the perception of personal agency the user has. It is explained that; “Agency means that the user feels relevant as an actor. Customization allows the individual user to feel unique and distinct. [...] customization is the most seductive aspect of modern online media because it is always related to an aspect of the self.”[^utz08mediated]

As well, agency often is brought up in anthropological discussions surrounding the internet and the massive flood of customized, constant advertising that comes with it. The discussion spills into the wider societal issue of consumerist culture as is explained by Rebekah Willet in Consumer Citizens Online: Structure, agency, and gender in online participation; “I am seeking to explore the relationships between the structures of consumerism (and wider societal discourses) and the agency (the capacity to think and act freely) of the young consumer/producer.”[^willet08consumer]
