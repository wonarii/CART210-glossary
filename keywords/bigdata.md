## Big Data
Big Data is the use of a large quantity of stored and analyzed information to form accurate understandings and predictions about the world. The wielding of this type of information processing has been accelerated by improvements in technology and the growing amounts of digital connections between people and organizations. [^AsktCite]

Big Data is used in everything from health care to political campaigns. Notably big data was a cornerstone of [Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns](http://www.jstor.org/stable/26466778) where personalized messaging and interaction were optimized by the assessment of potential voter preferences. [^LadonMurraycite] Large-scale data analysis was also used in the NBA to track player shooting accuracy. A sensor placed on the hoop would track and record the player’s shots from different points on the court. It would then be able to suggest where to shoot from to maximize winning potential.

In both of these examples, real-world phenomena were tracked and enumerated. They were then sent through systems and by people who would find patterns that could predict outcomes.
