### Historical Summary and Definition

"Computer" is first and foremost is a word that gets its origins from the latin word "Computare", roughly translated as "to calculate", or perhaps "someone who computes". 
The word started being widely recognized some time around the 1600's, and was used comfortably to describe human mathematicians of that era. [^rojas_hashagen_2002_first]

It was also around this time that different tools that could help with computing would start to appear, for example William Oughtred's slide rule, a mechanical analog device primarily used for multiplication, division, roots, logarithms, and trigonometry.
This word however, would see a paradigm shift of its use around the turn of the 17th - 18th century, as a computation moved towards mechanics and automation. 
In 1822, Charles Babbage would complete one of his inventions, announcing it as the "Difference Engine", 	designed to compute and print mathematical tables via automated mechanial calculations. [^garfinkel_grunspan_2019_abacus]

This invention could be the described as the precursor to the idea of the "Analytical Engine", largly known as the first mechanical computer ever made, though Babbage would never complete or build the machine as he envisioned it, passing in 1871.
The 19th century brought a series of groundbreaking innovations in the world of computation, paving the way for more modern computers. 
An important development came in the late 19th century with Herman Hollerith’s punched card machine.
The punched card machine used cards to automate the process of tabulating census data, which was a great leap in data management.
The machine functioned by reading the punched holes in the cards using electrical sensors, processing the data through internal mechanics, and finally outputting the results on a printout. [^pugh_heide_2013_card]

Opening the doors to greater computation power, the late 19th century also brought with it great advancements to our understanding of what we know now to be digital computing technology.
In 1936, Alan Turing created the "Turing Machine", a hypothetical computational model that was meant to answer the question of whether certain mathematical tasks could be computed.
His machine consisted of a long strip of tape with seperated symbols that were meant to store data, as well as a "head" that would move both left and right down the tape, being able to read, write, and make decisions in accordance to the tape.
Today the child of this idea is known as binary and widely used as part of the the basis of all of our programming knowledge. [^mol_2024_turing]

In a similar, if more physical sense, John Von Neumann created the "Von Neumann Architecture" in 1945. 
This was the model for a computer's organization that now forms the basis of most modern computers, acting as our introductions to the concept of CPU's (Central Processing Unit), RAM (Random-Access Memory), Input / Output Devices, and of course storing commands using memory.

### Relation to New Media and Modern Definition

As the idea of a computer became more widely known, understood, and of course used, it became engrained in nearly every bit of our culture.
The term "computer" is incredibly significant to new media because it has been cemented as a foundational concept to the way we interact with, and produce media today.
This term has never been just about the device itself but is instead a vehicle for technologies that create and transform data into interactive experiences.

For a grand majority of the modern peoples, their media, whether focused on education or entertainment, is the shared data we find on the internet.
In this case, computers act as our access to said data, allowing us to take, make, and change its form.
While a simple instrument would allow us to access a specific, or perhaps on some occasions numerous, forms of art, the computer allows us to access and transform a whole new world of information in an unimaginable number of ways. [^kay_1991_computers]

Graphic Design, Video Editing, Web Development, Social Entertainment Environments, and finally in great deal AI, all have computers to thank for their existence and continued development.
Our ability to govern, communicate, and collaberate has been increased significantly with this rise in technological understanding, and the ability to "compute" is no doubt what lead us to that understanding.

Paradigmatic examples of the use of computers that we often take for granted are Social Media Platforms, Streaming Services, and Video Games.
In conclusion, the computer is not only central to the production of new media but also to its constantly ongoing distribution.
