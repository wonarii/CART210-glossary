## Copyright

Copyright is a right that allows people to copy or recreate a work, ranging from artistic creations to a computer program. A person who owns the copyright of a certain work owns all the rights to it. It is used to protect it's creators from having their work copied, sold or posted online without their permission. Creators can extend the copyright to another person if they choose to do so.[^govcan23copyright] The laws of copyright vary from country to country, with some laws being stricter than others.

The first copyright law passed in America was in 1790 in the United States, which initially protectected books, maps and charts. In the 1800s, other mediums were added such as published music, dramatic works and works of art. Motion pictures were added as early as 1912 and computer programs joined the list in the late 80s. With the arrival of VHS tapes, the laws were updated to prevent private recordings from being sold.[^davidson00copyright]

Copyright can expire after a certain amount of years. The time it takes for it to expire may vary on the country. It would then fall into the public domain, where it becomes available to be used, distributed or reworked freely.[^dulongmartin12copyright]
