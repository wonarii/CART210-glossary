## Cyberculture

Cyberculture is a broad social and cultural movement shaped by the growth and spread of advanced digital technologies. It includes various social groups, forms of communication, and cultural practices that reflect how technology is transforming society. Cyberculture views technology as both a force for change and a tool for empowerment, fostering new types of influence, virtual spaces, and authentic digital experiences. Through online communities, digital interactions, and shared narratives, cyberculture redefines how people engage with technology and one another in an increasingly connected world.[^macek]

Cyberculture emerged in the 1960s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a term describing the evolving relationship between computers and networks. It gained prominence with William Gibson's 1984 novel Neuromancer, which was closely tied to the cyberpunk subculture. Initially linked to hackers and digital avant-garde communities in the 1980s, it became more established in the 1990s with the rise of the internet, evolving into a broader sociocultural and political movement that shapes new digital behaviors and practices.[^vicenteamaral]

As digital technologies continue to advance, cyberculture evolves, reshaping how people interact with cultural content. The concept of cultural interfaces highlights how computers present and structure media, drawing from influences like cinema, print, and human-computer interaction.[^manovich] As media shifts away from physical formats, digital interfaces adapt, blending familiar elements from traditional culture with new ways of navigating and experiencing information. The rise of hyperlinking in the 1990s further transformed cyberculture by encouraging non-linear, decentralized structures, challenging traditional hierarchies in media.[^vicenteamaral] These changes illustrate the ongoing interplay between technology and culture, shaping the way digital experiences are created and understood.
