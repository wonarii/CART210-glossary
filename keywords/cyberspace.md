## Cyberspace

It is a space where computers can interact with each other and share their data and content with each other. A reality that is computer generated, computer accessed and virtual. It is the place we are in during our communications through computers. It is a complete virtualisation of our physical world. [^bauwens94cyberspace]

The term ‘cyberspace’ was first used by William Gibson in 1982 when he used it to describe a computer generated virtual reality. ‘Cyber’ is related to ‘cyborg’ which describes humans connecting to machines. It is an artificial reality, another world. Networks and the Internet are examples of what we might consider a cyberspace. [^fourkas04cyberspace]

A global domain of interdependent networks of information systems infrastructures like the internet. It is a complex network environment formed by the connection of all these systems and technology devices. What exists in cyberspace doesn’t have physical form. It is made and accessed only through computers and their connections. [^nist12information]

Cyberspace is new representation of the physical world. It contains its own new ecosystem and media. This interlinked web of computers holds the space for new media to exist and permeate.
