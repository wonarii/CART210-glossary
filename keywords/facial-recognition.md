## Facial Recognition 

Facial recognition is a biometric technology that identifies or verifies individuals by analyzing facial features. It captures and processes facial data to convert it into a digital format for comparison using specialized algorithms.[^zhao03face]

The development of facial recognition dates to the 1960s when computational techniques for feature extraction were first explored.[^adjabi20past] One of the breakthroughs came with the introduction of "Eigenfaces", which applied principal component analysis (PCA) to improve recognition efficiency.[^adjabi20past] Over time, facial recognition methods have evolved into three major categories: holistic matching methods, feature-based methods, and hybrid methods.[^zhao03face] The integration of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), continues to improve the accuracy and speed of facial recognition systems,[^adjabi20past] which makes them crucial in contemporary applications such as smartphones and social media platforms.

Early facial recognition methods, like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Local Binary Patterns (LBP), faced challenges such as lighting variations, changes in pose, and occlusions.[^jafri09survey] These issues are now addressed by more advanced techniques like 3D facial recognition (which captures depth information for more accurate results), video-based recognition (which tracks facial motion across frames), and Infrared (IR) recognition (which contributes to better performance in low-light conditions). However, challenges persist, such as misidentification, motion blur, and the impact of accessories like eyeglasses.[^jafri09survey]

Today, facial recognition technology is widely used in security, authentication, and law enforcement. Governments and private companies employ it for border control, criminal investigations, and user authentication in smartphones and banking applications.[^jafri09survey] Facial recognition also lies in new media practices. For example, video indexing (labeling faces in video),[^jafri09survey] and Apple’s iPhone Face ID (enhancing security and user experience). However, its widespread adoption has raised privacy and ethical concerns, especially regarding personal privacy, mass surveillance, and algorithmic bias.[^raji20saving] Issues such as misidentification and discriminatory outcomes have led to increased scrutiny and regulatory measures to ensure responsible use.[^smith20ethical] As technology advances, efforts are being made to improve facial recognition accuracy while addressing privacy and ethical concerns.
