## Futurism

Futurism was an artistic and social movement that started in Italy at the beginning of the 20th century. The movement was started by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, publishing a manifesto in the French journal, Le Figaro.[^coenmunsgrove03futurism] During that time, new technologies were being developed at a rapid pace. Futurists rejected the past and believed in a future where technology ruled. Futurist ideas were expressed through painting, sculpture and even fashion, favoring less conventional elements to separate themselves from traditional methods used in these mediums, often putting an emphasis on dynamism and speed in their art.[^coenmunsgrove03futurism] Destruction was believed to bring change to their country in order to make it stronger and more developed.[^casden15futurism]

However, this movement was not without controversy. Because futurists had an industrialized view of the future, they deemed museums and libraries as unnecessary and advocated for their destruction. They also deemed feminism as unnecessary.[^casden15futurism][^luisettisomigli09futurism] Another reason for this is due to Italy not being as industrially developed during this time as the other powerful countries. Italy was often associated with classical art movements such as the Renaissance, making technological advancements seem more necessary than ever.[^casden15futurism] Futurism also had heavy ties to Fascism, with members siding with Mussolini after the First World War.[^luisettisomigli09futurism]
