## Haptics

The word “haptics” means ‘concerned with the sense of touch’ [^haptics1]. It is believed to have come from the Greek word “hapthesthai” [^haptics1]. In psychology and medicine, haptics refers to the study of how humans process sensory touch input through the body’s touch receptors [^haptics1]. In the late twentieth century, the definition had to be broadened because emergent technologies such as robots, video game consoles and virtual reality are all capable of creating touch sensations [^haptics2]. Thus, in the context of new media, haptics is defined as physical sensations—such as pushes or vibrations—that a user experiences while using an electronic device [^haptics3].
