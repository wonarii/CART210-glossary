## HTTPS

**HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)** is an extension of **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** that uses encryption to secure data exchanged between a user's browser and a web server. Through **SSL/TLS** protocols, it ensures data confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.

**Netscape** developed HTTPS in 1994 to secure online transactions for its browser. Initially, it used **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)** for encryption. Over time, SSL was replaced by **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**, a more secure and efficient protocol. HTTPS became essential as online commerce and sensitive data exchanges grew, gaining widespread adoption in the 2000s and now a standard for safe browsing.

### **The Importance of HTTPS in New Media**

In the digital age, new media has transformed how information is shared, consumed, and created. Securing data transmission from social media platforms to online journalism and e-commerce has become crucial. HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is a key technology enabling secure online communication. HTTPS plays a significant role in ensuring privacy, security, and trust in new media, making it an essential standard for modern websites and online interactions.

First and foremost, HTTPS provides encryption, protecting user data from cyber threats such as hacking, phishing, and eavesdropping. Unlike HTTP, which transmits data in plain text, HTTPS uses SSL/TLS encryption to safeguard sensitive information. This is particularly vital in new media environments where personal data, login credentials, and payment details are frequently exchanged. Users engaging with social media, news sites, or digital content platforms benefit from this added layer of security.

Additionally, HTTPS enhances trust and credibility. In an era of misinformation and cybersecurity threats, users are more cautious about which websites they interact with. A website with HTTPS displays a padlock icon in the browser, signalling that it is secure and trustworthy. Search engines like Google also prioritize HTTPS-enabled sites in rankings, reinforcing its importance for content creators, businesses, and media organizations looking to reach wider audiences.

Moreover, HTTPS is widely used across various new media platforms. Social networks, video streaming services, blogs, forums, and e-commerce websites rely on HTTPS to ensure safe user experiences. Secure communication is particularly crucial for online journalism and digital activism, where protecting the integrity of information and sources is paramount.

In conclusion, HTTPS is an indispensable component of new media, providing security, trust, and improved visibility for online platforms. As the digital landscape evolves, ensuring secure communication will remain fundamental to engaging with new media safely and effectively.
