# Information Overload

The human brain is the most complex organ in one of the most complex organisms on earth. It can process information sent through the rest of the body, and can register and comprehend imagery in as little as 13 milliseconds. [^Trafton14blinkofaneye]

With this in mind, there can sometimes be moments in which there is too much information present at once, where the cognative and motor functions of the human body may be stopped, as our brain is taking an astronomical amount of power and focus to comprehend and register it all. Much like the title may have been shown to be, this is called information overload.

Information overload occurs when the brain is presented with too much information at once, and has varying levels of overloading process that occurs with various types of people. Some may be able to handle perfectly fine, as they are more comfortable in high pressure scenarios. However, there are others with whom thoughts stop occurring in their head, or even freeze up, as their brain is attempting and failing to process all the information presented in front of them.

It doesn't just happen with seeing something in front of you, but registering if it's a threat, wondering where you may have seen something from, recalling events, seeing what others may want, seeing if the food is good, what the weather is like, *if the dog in the oncoming distance is ready to pounce, thinking of a random thought in the morning for whether or not a meteor will fall upon your head, getting handed documents at work that must be filled out all for this afternoons Scrum meeting and the pile goes on for so long that you wonder whether or not it will ever end, **seeing an old friend that you never liked and who you had a falling out with and they now have a girlfriend that you used to hang out with but you told rumors of her to all of her friends who unfriended her on Instagram and she never forgave you for such so now you have to turn the other way and attempt not to make eye contact and hope to the heavens above that they do not recognize you as they walk the same dog that looks like its about to pounce and a man gets cut off on the street next to you and honks the loud and obnoxious horn that startles you and almost makes you scream!!!***

What was just described was a possible example of information overload. Many people who are within their own heads too much tend to suffer from information overload. It happens more often to some than to others. It could be from a stressful day at work, a school project due in only a few days, or watching the news during a national disaster when everyone is trying to make sense of the current monsoon of information being flooded.

In 2000, two psychologists, Sheena Iyengar and Mark Lepper, set up an experiment to test this: they set up a booth at a food market for two days where they had a selection of jams on the table. Customers could approach, taste the jams, buy if they were interested, and then leave. A free sampling of jams. However, the two days didn't sell the same jams: on the first day, there was a selection of **24** jams to choose from. On the second day, however, there was only a section of **6** jams. What the study concluded was the following:
> - 3% of the crowd of customers bought jam on the first day.
> - 33% of the crowd of customers bought jam on the second day.
> - A larger crowd was attracted towards the larger display.
> - Customers, however, were **ten times** more likely to buy jam at the smaller display.

This study demonstrated the ability for choices to overload our senses and leave us almost incapable of decision-making for something as simple as buying jam. This classic example of information overload is one of the most popular examples of the subject. [^Schwarts06morebetter]

However, it's not just real life where this happens. The fast-paced age in which we currently live in offers a variety of ways to get information, and yet we can sometimes feel overwhelmed by the amount presented to us, especially through the ever-growing tumor in the brain that is the internet: **social media**.

It has been proven that the brain cannot comprehend a variety of the ways social media operates, from its constant stimulating feed to its false excuse for a network of friends. [^Lovink11networkcause] The internet prides itself on knowing more about you than even you do, with its new algorithmic-based method of navigation providing even more of an opportunity for it to bombard you with information, ads, and scams, all to siphon money out of your pockets by selling you ads for things that you don't need and can't afford.

"I should really take that trip to the Bahamas"<br>
"Now that I think about it, that grill of mine really doesn't work very well"<br>
"Woah, the newest iPhone has such crisp picture quality!<br>
"Those Balenciagas are soooooo in fashion, I need one!!

It's consumerism at its highest peak, and when the brain is overloaded on information to the point where the body almost achieves a zombified state as it mindlessly scrolls, anyone can do or sell anything to you.

Even to ignore the series of ads put within your face, the content itself also causes the brain to get overloaded with information, with user-generated content reaching an all-time peak in the history of the internet.[^Tang15trustinsocialmedia] YouTube reports that 500 hours of content are uploaded every minute. [^Fischbach20youtube] X reports that 350,000 tweets are sent every minute. [^Sayne22twitter] Facebook reports that 510,000 comments, 293,000 status updates, and 136,000 photos are uploaded every minute. [^Shepherd24facebook] Instagram reports that 95 million pieces of media are uploaded per day. [^Lister24instagram] There is so much user-generated content on these major platforms, and that doesn't even count TikTok, which does not show its amount of hours uploaded per minute, but can be assumed to be at least double that of YouTubes in the current year of 2024.

If we were to take the following information:
- 30,000 minutes of YouTube (500 * 60 minutes)
- 90,000 minutes of TikTok (1,500 * 60 minutes)
- 350,000 tweets
- 510,000 comments, 293,000 status updates, 136,000 photos
- 65,972 Instagram posts (95 million / 24 hours / 60 minutes)

It adds up to 1,474,972 different pieces of information across 5 of the most popular social medias on the internet uploaded ***every single minute***.

If we turn this number into meters, it would be equal to more than half the length of the Great Wall of China.

What the brain has experienced while reading the numbers mentioned above may have been akin to information overload. The senses went blurry and the brain got fogged. Maybe the attention may have been diverted to somewhere else, or the brain may have shut off entirely as to save itself from physical pain by nothing but reading text. Information overload takes many forms, and the takeaway from any of what was mentioned above was this:

**Spend more time dealing with the problems in your head and mentally fortifying before information overload assault you all at once like a hurricane.**
