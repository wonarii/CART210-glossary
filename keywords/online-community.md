## Online Community
Creating online communities means using the internet to bring people together, helping them interact, and making them feel like they belong to a group. 
These communities exist on websites, social media platforms, and other digital spaces where people can talk to each other, share ideas, and work together. 
Whether it’s through discussions, sharing content, or supporting each other, these online spaces allow people with similar interests to connect and build relationships, no matter where they are in the world[^bell05creating].

When learning how online communities function, researchers discovered three primary interaction patterns: direct reciprocity (people helping others with the expectation of future returns),
indirect reciprocity (contributing without immediate expectations, trusting in community support down the line),
and preferential attachment (newcomers gravitating toward established members).
Interestingly, the results reveal that most online communities thrive through both direct and indirect reciprocity,
challenging previous assumptions that digital interactions primarily follow popularity-driven power-law patterns[^faraj11network].

Research shows extreme-right groups gaining momentum through online communities where they connect with ideologically aligned people.
These groups respond to real-world events like political shifts and social movements by intensifying discussions, organizing collective action,
and reinforcing shared beliefs[^biluc20growing].
The study demonstrates how internet platforms can accelerate these groups' growth and influence by facilitating the spread of their viewpoints while nurturing a powerful sense of community and shared purpose.
