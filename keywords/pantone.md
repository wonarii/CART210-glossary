## Pantone
Pantone is a color system used in printing that allows for a universal agreement on specific colors we expect to get from print.

There are two color systems that designers can work with depending on their needs, the Pantone Matching System and the Pantone Fashion, Home + Interior System.  [^pantone24what]

#### Pantone Matching System (PMS):
This system is meant for designers who work on print projects such as editorial, packaging, digital and screenprinting.[^pantone24what]

#### Pantone Fashion, Home + Interior System (FHI):
This system is useful for projects a variety of projects unrelated to prints. It is often used by fashion designers and interior designers when working with apparel, fabrics, soft goods, cosmetics, paints, leather and accessories. [^pantone24what]

The purpose of having two color systems is to better control the appearance of color depending on the material the designer works with. Some colors can not be produced on certain materials. The Pantone system helps designers guarantee that the end product will match the exact Pantone color swatch they chose during production.

### Pantone vs [CMYK](../main/glossary.md#CMYK)
Pantone is more costly than printing in [CMYK](../main/glossary.md#CMYK) since it requires more labor. The print technician must follow color mix specifications to achieve the exact Pantone swatch requested. This process creates a color that is solid and saturated. On the other hand, [CMYK](../main/glossary.md#CMYK) in printing separates the file into cyan, magenta, yellow and black. Dots of each colors are printed on the surface to reach the final product. This can sometimes create variations in color differing from what is seen on the computer screen.[^paperstreet09when]

Using the Pantone system is good for printing projects that do not have many colors. It also allows designers to print colors unachievable with [CMYK](../main/glossary.md#CMYK) such as gold, silver and neon colors. However, [CMYK](../main/glossary.md#CMYK) can also do a decent print job, especially for projects with color photography. It is up to the designer to decide which system better suits their project.
