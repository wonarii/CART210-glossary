## Ransomware 

**Definition**:[^UKsecurity]  Ransomware is a type of malware which prevents you from accessing your device and the data stored on it, usually by encrypting your files. A criminal group will then demand a ransom in exchange for decryption.
**The birth of ransomware**[^Allan]  : Historically, ransomware dates back to an original piece of malicious code, known as AIDS, written in 1989 by Joseph Popp.
**How dose ransomware work**: 
 - Data access
 - Data encryption 
 - Demanding ransom

**Ransomware is highly relevant to new media because digital platforms, online services, and media companies are frequent targets of cyberattacks. The relationship between ransomware and new media can be explored through several key points:**

**1. How Ransomware Connects to New Media**
Digital Dependency: New media relies on cloud storage, digital publishing, and online platforms, all of which are vulnerable to ransomware attacks.
Media Companies as Targets: News organizations, streaming services, and content platforms store valuable data, making them prime targets.
Disinformation & Cybersecurity Risks: Hackers may use ransomware to control or alter digital narratives, censor journalism, or manipulate public opinion.
**2. Where Ransomware is Used in New Media**
News Organizations: Attackers have targeted news agencies (e.g., The Guardian was hit by ransomware in 2022), disrupting operations.
Streaming & Entertainment Platforms: Netflix and other content providers face ransomware threats, with hackers leaking unreleased movies and shows.
Social Media & Influencers: High-profile social media accounts can be hijacked for ransom, causing reputational damage.
Gaming & Digital Art: Game developers and NFT creators have suffered ransomware attacks, losing valuable digital assets.
**3. Why It’s Relevant**
Threat to Press Freedom: Journalists can be silenced through ransomware attacks, undermining free speech.
Economic Impact: New media companies can lose millions due to downtime and ransom payments.
Evolving Cybersecurity Landscape: The rise of AI and digital platforms increases the risks of cyberattacks.

**Ransomware Examples**
   - SamSam : SamSam first appeared in 2015. It mainly targets healthcare businesses.
   - CryptoLocker :The Trojan Horse virus known as CryptoLocker spreads via unidentified attachments in staff emails. With CryptoLocker, only users of Microsoft® Windows® are in danger; Mac™ users are unaffected. Once your files get encrypted, a countdown timer starts.
   - Ryuk: Ryuk is one of the most harmful ransomware variants due to the extreme ransom amount demanded. Millions of dollars may be required to restore data after a Ryuk attack. Like other viruses, Ryuk spreads via phishing. After infecting a system, it begins shutting down operations on the victim’s computer.
   - Cerber : When Cerber initially debuted in 2016, it was incredibly profitable for attackers, earning them $200,000 in just July of that year. To infiltrate networks, it made use of a Microsoft® vulnerability.


**How to defend against cyber threats**:[^cyberCanada] 
1.	Cyber defence planning: There are several approaches you can take to enhance the protection of your networks and devices. The following list of items provides details on several security controls you can implement to effectively enhance your cyber security posture.
   1.1 Develop your backup plan: Develop and implement a backup plan for your organization. A backup is a copy of your data and systems that can be restored in the event of an incident.
   1.2 Develop your incident response plan: Developing an incident response plan for your organization is the keystone to your cyber defence strategy. You should also consider developing a disaster recovery plan for your business. Through these two plans, your organization considers major events that could cause an unplanned outage and require you to activate your recovery response. Your incident response plan helps you detect and respond to cyber security incidents. Your disaster recovery plan focuses on how the organization recovers and resumes critical business functions after an incident.
   1.3 Develop your recovery plan
   1.4 Manage user and administrator accounts

2. Cyber security controls
   2.1 Establish perimeter defences
   2.2 Implement logging and alerting
   2.3 Conduct penetration testing
   2.4 Segment your networks
   2.5 Constrain scripting environments and disable macros
   2.6 Patch and update
   2.7 Create an application allow list
   2.8 Use protective domain name system (DNS)
   2.9 Apply password management
   2.10 Use email domain protection
