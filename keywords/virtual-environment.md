## Virtual Environment

Virtual environments are the technology which facilitates interactions between users and computer-generated artificial environments.[^ve3] These interactive computer displays are designed to create the illusion that the user has been transported to a different location.[^ve1] In a virtual world, the user can use their senses and their body in a similar way to the real world. They can turn their head to see their surroundings, trace sounds to the direction they are coming from, and use their hands to pick up virtual objects [^ve2]. Virtual environments are thus the most natural form of interaction between humans and computers.[^ve2]
